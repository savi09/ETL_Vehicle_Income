# ETL_Vehicle_Income
Extract Transform and Load process to pgAdmin with Vehicle Data and Income Tax Data.

## Three steps:
#### 1. Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).

My two original data sources were:
  * [zip_income_info](https://github.com/savi09/ETL_Vehicle_Income/blob/main/Resources/zip_income_info.csv)
  *   This source is a CSV file.
  *   It came from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/hamishgunasekara/average-income-per-zip-code-usa-2018)
  * [zip_vehicle_info](https://github.com/savi09/ETL_Vehicle_Income/blob/main/Resources/zip_vehicle_info.csv)
  *   This source is, also, a CSV file.
  *   It came from [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/vehicle-fuel-type-count-by-zip-code/resource/d304108a-06c1-462f-a144-981dd0109900)

#### 2. Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.

#### 3. Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
